    * I have implemented and compared multiple algorithms (OMWU, BM, and TreeSwap) and also developed a new algorithm, Multi-Stage Multiplicative-Weights Update (MS-MWU), which converges significantly faster than any of the existing no-regret algorithms (OMWU, BM, TreeSwap) across all of our experiments.
