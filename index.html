<p>I am a Junior at Lexington High School in the Boston area. I'm seeking an opportunity as an Academic Research Assistant. I've been programming in C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript for seven years. Furthermore, I am well-versed in LaTeX and HTML/CSS. </p>
<p>In 10th grade, I had the privilege of being accepted into the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program/">MIT PRIMES research program</a>, where I am fortunate to receive guidance from <a href="https://noahgol.github.io/">Noah Golowich</a> on algorithmic game theory. I have implemented and compared multiple algorithms(OMWU, BM, and TreeSwap) and also developed a new algorithm Multi-Stage Multiplicative-Weights Update(MS-MWU), that is converges significantly faster than any of the existing no-regret algorithms (OMWU, BM, TreeSwap) across all our experiments.
Earlier during both the 7th and 9th grades, I was selected for the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/step.html">MIT PRIMES STEP research program</a> and had the honor of being advised by <a href="https://www.tanyakhovanova.com/">Tanya Khovanova</a>.</p>
