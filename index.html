<p>I am a junior at Lexington High School in the Boston area. I'm seeking an opportunity as an Academic Research Assistant. I've been programming in C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript for seven years. Furthermore, I am well-versed in LaTeX and HTML/CSS. </p>
<p>In 10th grade and 11th grade, I have the privilege of being accepted into the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program/" target="_blank">MIT PRIMES research program</a>, where I am fortunate to receive guidance from 
  <a href="https://toc.csail.mit.edu/user/367" target="_blank">Maxwell Fishelson</a> and <a href="https://noahgol.github.io/" target="_blank">Noah Golowich</a> on algorithmic game theory. 
I have implemented and compared multiple algorithms (OMWU, BM, and TreeSwap) and also developed a new algorithm, Multi-Stage Multiplicative-Weights Update (MS-MWU), which converges significantly faster than any of the existing no-regret algorithms (OMWU, BM, TreeSwap) across all of our experiments.
In both the 7th and 9th grades, I was selected for the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/step.html" target="_blank">MIT PRIMES STEP research program</a> and had the honor of being advised by 
  <a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=131" target="_blank">Tanya Khovanova</a>.
These experiences have been incredibly rewarding, teaching me how to approach complex problems and think critically.
Iâ€™m also honored to have been accepted into the highly selective and prestigious BU RISE (Research in Science & Engineering) summer program <a href="https://www.bu.edu/summer/high-school-programs/rise-internship-practicum/" target="_blank">, where I will focus on the Data Science track.</p>
<p>Math has always been a huge part of my life. My mathematical accomplishments include qualifying for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad" target="_blank">USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO)</a> and 
  receiving <a href="https://maa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-USAMO-Awardees.pdf" target="_blank">Honorable Mention</a>, and 
  qualifying for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad" target="_blank">USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO)</a>, 
and since the 6th grade, I have consistently qualified 5 times for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination" target="_blank">American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)</a>. 
I have also earned places on the Distinction Honor Roll for AMC12 and Distinguished Honor Roll (DHR) for AMC10 and AMC8. During my participation in MOEMS, I attained a perfect score and received the George Lenchner Award. 
In computer science, I have reached the Platinum (Certified) Division of <a href="http://www.usaco.org/" target="_blank">USACO (USA Computing Olympiad)</a>, and I earned a near-perfect score in <a href="https://www.acsl.org/" target="_blank">ACSL (American Computer Science League)</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, I'm the Captain and a Coder at <a href="http://lhsvex.org" target="_blank">Lexington High School VEX Robotics Team</a>. In the 2024-2025 competition season, our team became tournament champion and earned regional qualification. 
I'm also an oboe player and serve as the section leader in the concert band, as well as a member of LHS's highest-level band, the Wind Ensemble. In my free time, I enjoy reading, biking, and, of course, playing my oboe.</p>
