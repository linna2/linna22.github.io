<p>I am a Junior at Lexington High School in the Boston area. I'm seeking an opportunity as an Academic Research Assistant. I've been programming in C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript for seven years. Furthermore, I am well-versed in LaTeX and HTML/CSS. </p>
<p>In 10th grade, I had the privilege of being accepted into the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program/">MIT PRIMES research program</a>, where I am fortunate to receive guidance from <a href="https://noahgol.github.io/">Noah Golowich</a> on algorithmic game theory. 
I have implemented and compared multiple algorithms(OMWU, BM, and TreeSwap) and also developed a new algorithm Multi-Stage Multiplicative-Weights Update(MS-MWU), that is converges significantly faster than any of the existing no-regret algorithms (OMWU, BM, TreeSwap) across all our experiments.
Earlier during both the 7th and 9th grades, I was selected for the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/step.html">MIT PRIMES STEP research program</a> and had the honor of being advised by <a href="https://www.tanyakhovanova.com/">Tanya Khovanova</a>.</p>
<p>My mathematical accomplishments include qualifying for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad">USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO)</a>, 
and since the 6th grade, I have consistently qualified 5 times for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination">American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)</a>. 
I have also earned places on the Distinction for AMC12 and Distinguished Honor Roll(DHR) for AMC10 and AMC8. During my participation in MOEMS, I attained a perfect score and received the George Lenchner Award. 
In computer science, I have reached the Gold Division of <a href="http://www.usaco.org/">USACO(USA Computing Olympiad)</a>, and I earned a near-perfect score in <a href="https://www.acsl.org/">ACSL(American Computer Science League)</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, I'm the Captain and a Coder at <a href="http://lhsvex.org">Lexington High School VEX Robotics Team</a>. In the 2024 competition season, our team advanced to the finals and earned regional qualification. 
I'm also an oboe player in the concert band as a section leader. In my free time, I enjoy playing the oboe, reading and biking.</p>
