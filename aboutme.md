Hi, I’m Michael.

I’m someone who finds joy in asking “why?”—and occasionally “why not?” Whether I’m exploring the theoretical underpinnings of a problem or building something hands-on, I’m drawn to challenges that require both precision and imagination.

I’ve learned that I’m happiest when I’m fully immersed—thinking through a proof that resists easy answers, debugging code at midnight, or collaborating on a project where every teammate brings a different perspective. I don’t just want to learn how things work; I want to stretch them, question them, and sometimes even reinvent them.

Outside of structured academics, I value self-driven work. Some of my most meaningful experiences have come from independent exploration—experimenting with new algorithms, learning from research mentors, or prototyping ideas that never quite “worked,” but taught me something anyway.

What excites me most about college isn’t just the coursework—though I look forward to being challenged intellectually—it’s the culture of curiosity, collaboration, and pushing boundaries. I want to be in a place where it’s normal to debate a math problem over dinner or stay up late building something that no one assigned.

Thanks for taking the time to visit. If anything here resonates—or raises questions—I’d love to talk.
