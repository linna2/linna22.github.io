Hi, I’m Michael.

I like asking "why" and sometimes "why not." Whether I'm thinking through a tricky problem or building something hands-on, I’m drawn to challenges that need both logic and creativity.

I’m at my best when I’m fully into something. That could mean working through a proof that refuses to make sense, debugging code late at night, or teaming up with people who see things differently. I don’t just want to understand how things work. I want to push them, rethink them, and sometimes build something completely new.

Some of the most meaningful things I’ve done have come from following my own curiosity. I’ve tested algorithms just to see what would happen, learned from research mentors, and chased ideas that didn’t always work out but still taught me a lot.

What excites me most about college isn’t just the classes, even though I’m looking forward to those. It’s the environment. I want to be in a place where it’s normal to argue over a math problem at dinner or stay up late building something just because it sounds interesting.

Thanks for reading. If anything here stands out or sparks a question, I’d love to talk.
